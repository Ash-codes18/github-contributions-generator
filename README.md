# GitHub contributions generator

A script written in Go, which goal is to make your GitHub contributions graph the way you want it to be.

## How to run the random option
1. Create an fully empty GitHub repository (not even a README). Do not initialize it.
2. For the basic option (contribute the entire year), you run the command:
```sh
go run . random -repository="https://github.com/yourUserName/yourRepo.git"
```
Because it has to commit for each day of the year, this can take a few minutes to complete.
Note: After the script finishes, you have to wait for GitHub to register and show the changes.

E.g., if you enter 20, you will contribute 73 days out of 1 year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

If you enter 3-5, you will only commit from march(starting the same day of month as today) to may. Entering only one number like 8(october) will prompt the script to commit only on the specified month. <br /> <br /> Note that GitHubs contribution time frame is current date minus one year. So if our current month is february and you enter the flag -month=1-3, it won't contribute from january to march. It will contribute from february to april, because the 1st month in contributions panel is the current month. |
